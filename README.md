# Advent of Code

My takes on some AOC puzzles. My goal is to ultimately solve puzzles from previous years as well.

This is not at all meant to be a repo of amazing code, quite the contrary, I will do my best to explore new features in languages, use as many languages as I can, perhaps even try new ones, and of course improve my problem solving skills in the ones I already "know". I might also go back and change things up if I see/learn something new post posting, so what you see here is not necessarily *exactly* what got me the stars!

***tl;dr*** the code will be clunky and inconsistent but I will have fun😄

I will attach a README with every puzzle to briefly explain my thought process, inspired by my friend [Sarek](https://github.com/sarsko)😁
